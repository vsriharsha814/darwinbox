# My Work at Darwinbox (2022‚Äì2024)

This repository serves as a **centralized portfolio** of my key accomplishments and contributions as a Software Engineer at **Darwinbox**, a leading HR-tech unicorn used by over 2 million employees globally. Rather than detailing every minor fix, this readme highlights the **major projects**, **technologies leveraged**, and the **impact** I delivered.

## üöÄ Key Contributions

- **Microsoft Teams Integration**: Built an end-to-end solution enabling employees to apply for leave, check attendance, and access HR workflows directly within MS Teams, driving a seamless user experience and boosting adoption by 35%.
- **Settings API for Chatbot**: Designed and implemented a dynamic settings API to replace hardcoded configurations in the HR chatbot, reducing deployment issues by 70% and slashing manual setup time.
- **RAG Pipeline for HR Chatbot**: Transitioned our Retrieval-Augmented Generation pipeline from Pinecone to MongoDB Vector Search, doubling answer relevance and cutting latency by 40%, which led to a 50% reduction in failure tickets.
- **Scalable Microservices Architecture**: Migrated core HR services to a microservices-based design using Docker and Kubernetes, improving system reliability and enabling 3√ó throughput under peak loads.
- **CI/CD & DevTools Enhancements**: Introduced automated CI/CD pipelines with CircleCI and Terraform, ensuring zero-downtime deployments and accelerating release cycles from biweekly to daily.
- **Developer Mentorship & Process Improvements**: Mentored new hires and interns, led code-review best practices workshops, and standardized RESTful API guidelines across teams.

## üìã Project Details

### 1. Microsoft Teams Integration
- **Role**: Sole backend engineer responsible for Teams API authentication, Graph calls, and middleware.
- **Technologies**: Node.js, Express.js, Microsoft Graph SDK, OAuth 2.0.
- **Impact**: 35% increase in self-service HR actions, 20% reduction in HR support tickets.

### 2. Settings API for Chatbot
- **Problem**: Chatbot settings were hardcoded, causing frequent sync issues across environments.
- **Solution**: Developed a RESTful Settings API in Python/Flask to fetch live configurations from MongoDB, with built-in validation and versioning.
- **Impact**: Manual configuration steps eliminated, deployment errors down by 70%.

### 3. RAG Pipeline for HR Chatbot
- **Challenge**: The existing RAG pipeline hallucinated due to limited context windows and slow vector lookups.
- **Solution**: Led proof-of-concept to compare Pinecone and MongoDB Vector Search; rolled out MongoDB Vector Store with optimized index configurations.
- **Impact**: 2√ó improvement in answer relevance, 40% faster response times, and a 50% drop in user-reported issues.

### 4. Scalable Microservices Architecture
- **Approach**: Broke monolithic HR core into domain-driven microservices (Leave, Attendance, Payroll).
- **Stack**: Docker, Kubernetes, Helm charts, Redis, RabbitMQ for event-driven communication.
- **Benefits**: 3√ó system throughput, improved fault isolation, and faster feature rollout.

### 5. CI/CD & DevTools Enhancements
- **Implementation**: Created Terraform scripts for infrastructure-as-code; set up CircleCI workflows for build, test, and deploy stages.
- **Outcome**: Zero-downtime deployments, release velocity improved from biweekly to daily, and 80% fewer rollback incidents.

### 6. Mentorship & Process Improvements
- **Initiatives**: Organized monthly technical brown-bag sessions; authored API style guides and best-practice documentation.
- **Results**: Onboarded 5+ engineers/interns smoothly; unified API standards reduced integration bugs by 60%.
